# Interpreter Design Pattern

## Scenario: Language Translator

### Problem Statement
The objective is to design and develop a language translator system that can translate text from Tamil to English using an interpreter-based approach. The system should be capable of understanding Tamil input and providing the corresponding translation in English. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Interpreter Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Grammar and Syntax Representation:** <br>
The Interpreter Pattern is especially useful when expressions need to be evaluated based on a formal grammar or set of rules. In this case, both Tamil and English languages have distinct syntaxes and grammar rules. By using the Interpreter Pattern, we can define the grammar for both languages and interpret Tamil sentences according to those rules, translating them into English. The pattern simplifies the process of transforming complex language structures into understandable components. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Building a Recursive Translation System:**  <br>
Language translation often involves recursive structures (such as phrases, sub-clauses, and compound sentences) that require translating smaller components into larger ones. The Interpreter Pattern supports this recursive nature: it interprets rules at multiple levels, starting from individual words and expanding into larger sentence structures. For example, a complex Tamil sentence could be split into smaller units (subject-verb-object), and each part can be translated recursively. This recursive design is perfect for handling intricate language translation tasks. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Handling Language Variants:** <br>
Both Tamil and English exhibit various dialects and regional variations. The Interpreter Pattern enables the encoding of different interpretations for these variations. For example, the same Tamil word might have multiple meanings depending on its regional context. The Interpreter Pattern provides a way to address such differences by incorporating multiple rules for different interpretations, ensuring a more flexible and adaptable translation system. <br>

### Intent
The intent of the Interpreter Pattern is to provide a way to interpret or evaluate expressions based on a specific grammar or set of rules. In the context of translation, it interprets a source language (Tamil) based on its grammar and syntax and converts it into a target language (English).

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the []().

2. Flyweight <br>
3. Iterator <br>
4. Visitor <br>

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**Evaluating Mathematical Expressions:** In addition to language translation, the Interpreter Pattern can also be applied in scenarios where mathematical expressions need to be evaluated. These expressions consist of numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and the pattern can be used to evaluate them based on predefined arithmetic rules. <br>
