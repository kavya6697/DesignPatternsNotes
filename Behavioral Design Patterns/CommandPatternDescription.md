# Command Design Pattern

## Scenario: Office Automation System with Task Management

### Problem Statement
In modern office environments, employees routinely perform various tasks such as printing documents, sending emails, and generating reports. These tasks may be initiated by different personnel, including office assistants, managers, or team members, and need to be executed by the appropriate tools or systems (e.g., printers, email servers, or report generation software). The goal is to design a system that can queue these tasks, execute them sequentially, and optionally provide undo/redo capabilities for certain actions. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Command Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Queueing Multiple Commands:** <br>
The Command pattern allows commands to be stored and executed later, making it possible to queue tasks and schedule them flexibly. This is particularly useful in environments where tasks need to be completed in a specific order or at a later time. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Implementing Undo/Redo Functionality:**  <br>
By storing the state of each executed command, it becomes possible to reverse actions (e.g., canceling a print request or undoing an email sent) or repeat them (e.g., reprinting a document). Undo/redo capabilities are essential in office environments where tasks might need to be corrected or adjusted. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Support for Complex Task Compositions:** <br>
In an advanced office automation system, commands can be composed of multiple smaller commands, allowing for the execution of complex workflows or macros. For example, you could combine printing, emailing, and report generation into a single composite command, making the system more powerful and efficient when handling intricate processes. <br>

### Intent
The Command Pattern aims to encapsulate a request as an object, which enables the parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It decouples the sender (invoker) of the request from the receiver (the object that performs the actual work). This leads to more flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in the system.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the []().

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**School Management System:** In a school management system, administrators, teachers, and staff often need to perform various tasks, such as enrolling students, assigning grades, and generating reports. These tasks need to be executed in a flexible and decoupled manner. By using the Command pattern, each task can be encapsulated as a command, allowing the system to handle requests dynamically, queue tasks, and even support undo/redo for operations like grade changes or enrollment adjustments. <br>
