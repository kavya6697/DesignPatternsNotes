# Composite Design Pattern

## Scenario: Organization Restructuring

### Problem Statement
In a company, management needs to restructure the organizational hierarchy by making changes to teams and departments. The company operates with a hierarchical structure, involving employees, managers, and departments. Employees may need to be moved between departments, placed under different managers, or promoted to managerial positions. Departments could be merged under new managers, and employees may be added or removed during the restructuring. The goal is to create a system that represents the organizational structure and provides a flexible way to manage employees, managers, and departments. The system should support operations such as adding, removing, and relocating employees and managers with ease. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Composite Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Uniform Treatment of Objects:** <br>
The Composite Design Pattern allows for the uniform treatment of both employees and managers by defining a common interface or base class (e.g., Employee). This enables operations like add(), remove(), and getDetails() to be applied seamlessly to both employees and managers, despite their different internal behaviors. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Hierarchical Structure:**  <br>
The Composite Design Pattern is ideal for modeling tree-like structures, where composite objects (such as managers or departments) can contain leaf objects (employees), and composite objects can also contain other composite objects. This supports a flexible organizational structure. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Recursive Structure:** <br>
The pattern supports recursive structures, where a composite (manager) can manage other composites or leaf nodes (employees). This is essential for handling teams, sub-teams, and various levels of management in an organization. <br>

### Intent
The intent of the Composite Pattern is to compose objects into tree-like structures that represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and their compositions uniformly.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the []().

1. Decorator <br>
2. Builder <br>
3. Iterator <br>
4. Visitor <br>

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**File Structure:** In a computer file system, a directory can contain both files and other directories. Directories can be nested, and all elements (files or folders) can be treated uniformly at a high level, even though they have different functionalities. <br>
