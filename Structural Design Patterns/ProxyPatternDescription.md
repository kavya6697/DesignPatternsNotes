# Proxy Design Pattern

## Scenario: Remote Service Access

### Problem Statement
Imagine you are developing a cloud-based application that needs to interact with a remote server to retrieve large datasets. Directly accessing the remote server every time data is needed could lead to latency issues, repeated network calls, and a poor user experience. Additionally, security concerns, such as ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive data, need to be addressed. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Proxy Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Improve Performance and Efficiency (Lazy Initialization & Caching):** <br>
_Lazy Initialization:_ Direct access to a remote service for each request can be slow, especially if the service is on a different server or involves complex data retrieval processes. The proxy pattern defers the actual network call until the data is required, reducing unnecessary latency.
_Caching:_ The proxy can cache data once retrieved from the remote service, allowing subsequent requests for the same data to be served from the cache, minimizing redundant network calls and improving system performance. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Maintain Consistency and Control Over Remote Service Access:**  <br>
In cases where the remote service undergoes updates or maintenance, the proxy acts as an intermediary. It can handle fallback mechanisms, retries, and graceful degradation, ensuring the client does not need to manage these complexities. This enhances system resilience and simplifies maintenance. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Decouple Client from Remote Service:** <br>
The proxy pattern introduces an abstraction layer between the client and the remote service. The client interacts with the proxy, which handles all the underlying details, such as network communication, error handling, and retries, thereby simplifying the client's interaction with the service.<br>

### Intent
The Proxy Design Pattern provides a placeholder or surrogate object to control access to another object, particularly when dealing with remote or external services. The proxy exposes an identical interface to the client, allowing it to interact with the proxy as though it were the actual service. This prevents the client from needing to directly interact with the remote object and abstracts complexities such as latency, caching, or security.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the [ProxyPatternImplementation.py](https://github.com/kavya6697/DesignPatternsNotes/blob/main/Structural%20Design%20Patterns/ProxyPatternImplementation.py).

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**Microsoft OLEDB:** In Microsoft OLEDB, the proxy pattern is used to abstract whether the server is local or remote. The proxy operates on the firewall machine, allowing clients inside the firewall to access external services concurrently without directly connecting to the outside world. <br>
