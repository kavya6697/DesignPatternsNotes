# Facade Design Pattern

## Scenario: Automatic Home Theater System

### Problem Statement
A home theater system typically involves multiple components, such as the TV, DVD player, sound system, and lights, each with its own control system. To create a seamless and enjoyable movie-watching experience, the user needs to manually interact with each component separately—turning on the TV, selecting the correct input, adjusting sound settings, and dimming the lights. This multi-step process can be overwhelming, especially for non-technical users. Therefore, the system should automate and streamline this process to enhance the overall experience. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Facade Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Simplification of Complex Interactions:** <br>
The Facade pattern offers a single, unified interface to control all the components of the home theater system, such as the TV, DVD player, sound system, and lighting. This simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to interact with each device individually.  <br>

&nbsp; **2. Encapsulation of Complexity:**  <br>
The Facade pattern hides the underlying complexity and interactions between the various components. Users no longer need to understand how each device works or how they interact with each other; they simply rely on the facade to manage these operations behind the scenes.  <br>

&nbsp; **3. Maintainability and Scalability:** <br>
With the Facade in place, any changes to individual components or the addition of new components can be handled without affecting the user's experience. From the user's perspective, the process remains the same—a single action to initiate the entire system—regardless of any changes or upgrades to the underlying hardware. This ensures maintainability and scalability.<br>

### Intent
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying interaction with complex systems.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the [FacadePatternImplementation.py](https://github.com/kavya6697/DesignPatternsNotes/blob/main/Structural%20Design%20Patterns/FacadePatternImpelmentation.py).

### Related Patterns
1. Abstract Factory <br>
2. Mediator <br>
3. Flyweight <br>

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**Loan application:** The loan application process is often complex, requiring multiple steps, such as verifying credit, checking income, and reviewing terms. By introducing an agent who acts as a facade, the process becomes smoother. The agent interacts with the various departments, simplifying the experience for the customer.<br>
