# Flyweight Design Pattern

## Scenario: Game Application Optimization

### Problem Statement
Imagine a video game where multiple players interact within a shared virtual world. Each player has a character with attributes such as name, health, position, and appearance. However, many players have similar or identical appearances (e.g., the same avatar model, similar equipment, etc.). As the number of players grows into the thousands, memory usage becomes a serious concern, especially since many of the player attributes are repetitive. Storing the entire appearance (e.g., avatar's graphical assets) for each player instance would consume a significant amount of memory, which needs to be optimized.

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Flyweight Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Memory Efficiency:** <br>
When objects share common properties (such as avatars, icons, or text styles), storing those properties individually for every object can consume an immense amount of memory. The Flyweight Pattern optimizes memory usage by storing shared data in a central location and allowing multiple objects to reference it, thus eliminating unnecessary duplication. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Separation of Intrinsic and Extrinsic States:**  <br>
The Flyweight pattern clearly separates the intrinsic state (shared, immutable data) from the extrinsic state (unique, mutable data). Intrinsic state is shared across instances, while extrinsic state is maintained separately for each object. This separation reduces memory usage by avoiding redundancy, while still allowing each object to retain its individual characteristics. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Scalability:** <br>
The Flyweight Pattern is ideal for applications that need to handle large volumes of similar objects. In multiplayer games, social media apps, or graphical applications with many similar elements (e.g., trees in a forest), the Flyweight Pattern enables efficient management of large numbers of objects, without overwhelming memory capacity. <br>

### Intent
Use sharing to efficiently manage a large number of objects.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the []().

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**FT++:** FT++ uses the Flyweight Pattern to support look-and-feel independence in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), allowing components to share common styling elements while still enabling individual customizations. <br>
