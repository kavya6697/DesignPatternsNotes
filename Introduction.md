# Introduction to Design Patterns
Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a template about how to solve a problem; same template can be used in many different situations.
Consistency, clarity, time, and reuse are the pros of using design patters, whereas, anti-patterns, careful while choosing the pattern, negative consequences, subjective dependence on concrete scenarios, different interpretations are the cons in using design patterns.
## 15 Facts about Design Patterns
1. Design patterns are different ways to enforce the fundamental design principles.
2. Design patterns (DP) can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
3. Reusing DP helps to prevent issues that can cause major problems (extensibility).
4. Improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
5. DP provides general solutions demonstrated in a format that does not require specific tie to a particular problem.
6. Patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known and well-understood names of software interactions.
7. Common DP can be improved over time, making them robust than ad-hoc designs.
8. DP use OO Concepts like decomposition, inheritance, and polymorphism to improve software development process.
9. DP provides a way to get benefit from the experience and knowledge of your predecessors those have worked on the same type of project.
10. Appropriate DP used in development of applications make development fast and easy documented.
11. DP are more sophisticated and advance approaches than basic data structures.
12. None of the DP describes anything about new or unproven design changes. They only include designs applied more than once in different systems.
13. DPs are part of the OO-community or DPs are the elements of some successful OO-systems.
14. DPs should be easy to learn for inexperienced developers.
15. DPs are not dealing with designing user interfaces.
