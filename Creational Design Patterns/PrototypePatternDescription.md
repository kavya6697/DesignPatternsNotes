# Prototype Design Pattern

## Scenario: Icon Design

### Problem Statement

A designer is tasked with creating a set of icons that are visually distinct but must maintain consistency in style and size. Currently, each icon is designed from scratch, which increases the risk of inconsistency across the icon set. Additionally, when the design evolves, updating or modifying individual icons is inefficient since each one requires manual adjustments. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation for choosing Prototype Design Pattern

&nbsp; **1. Ensuring Consistency:** <br>
The Prototype Pattern guarantees that all icons are based on the same prototype. This ensures that core design elements, such as structure, color scheme, and proportions, remain consistent across the icon set. <br>

&nbsp; **2.  Flexibility in Customization:**  <br>
Using the Prototype pattern, designers can easily clone a base icon and make slight modifications, such as changing colors, adding new elements, or altering shapes. This flexible cloning process allows for quick adjustments, enabling the creation of icons that adapt to different contexts, like dark mode or various color themes.  <br>

&nbsp; **3. Reduced Risk of Errors::** <br>
The Prototype Pattern minimizes the risk of inconsistencies or errors by ensuring that all icons are derived from the same core design. Since all icons are clones of a prototype, designers can avoid accidental variations, resulting in high-quality, uniform designs. <br>

### Intent

The Prototype Design Pattern involves creating new objects with variations by cloning an existing prototype. This approach ensures that the core design remains consistent while offering flexibility for customization. 

### Python Implementation

1. Abstract Factory <br>
2. Composite <br>

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**1. Resume Builder Tool:** A resume builder tool offers users the ability to create resumes using different templates (e.g., minimalist, modern, professional, creative). The structure of the resume must remain consistent across templates, but users can customize sections like skills, work experience, education, and personal details. The Prototype Pattern ensures consistency in layout while providing flexibility for customization across various templates. <br>
