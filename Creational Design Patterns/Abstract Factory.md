# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Scenario: Apparel Company - Clothing Line Expansion

### Problem Statement
FashionCo is a leading apparel brand known for casual wear. With increasing demand, the company now wants to expand its offerings to include formal wear and sportswear. Each collection will feature shirts, trousers, jackets, shoes, and other items for men, women, and children, available in various fabrics and colors. <br>

**As a software architect, what design pattern would you suggest to satisfy this requirement?**

### Motivation

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is ideal for this scenario for the following key reasons:<br>

&nbsp; **1. Consistency Across Product Families:** <br>
The Abstract Factory pattern ensures that FashionCo can maintain internal consistency across product families. For example, a formal shirt should always be paired with formal pants, not with pants from casual wear. This consistency ensures that related products are always used together, making the system more predictable and easier to manage. <br>

&nbsp; **2. Flexibility for Expansion:**  <br>
The Abstract Factory pattern allows FashionCo to easily add new clothing lines, such as Luxury or Streetwear, by simply creating a new factory for each line. This can be done without disrupting existing lines. Since the client interacts through the main factory, it remains unaware of the specific factories behind each clothing line. This provides flexibility for future growth without requiring changes to the client code. <br>

&nbsp; **3. Separation of Concerns:** <br>
The Abstract Factory pattern helps FashionCo separate the business logic of different clothing lines into individual factories. Each factory is responsible for creating the specific products for one clothing line (e.g., casual, formal, or sportswear). This separation means changes made to one clothing line won't affect  others, making the system more maintainable.<br>

### Intent
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. In this case, FashionCo can create different product families (e.g., formal wear, casual wear) through abstract factories, allowing for easier management of diverse product lines.

### Python Implementation
The Python implementation for this pattern can be found in the AbstractFactory.py file.

2. Prototype <br>
3. Factory Method <br>

### Other Real-world Applicable Scenarios

**1. BigC Mobile Showroom:** A mobile showroom that offers various models from brands like Samsung, Apple, and others. Each brand has different product lines (smartphones, tablets, accessories, etc.) with unique specifications, designs, and features. <br>
  
**2. Hyundai:** A manufacturer that produces various vehicles, including cars, scooters, and electric vehicles. Each vehicle type (car, scooter, electric vehicle) requires specific components, designs, and manufacturing processes, making the Abstract Factory pattern useful for managing the different product lines.
